            <h2>and the whole world’s invited</h2>
        </div>
        <p>With this fun game, you can compete with your friends, enemies, or strangers on the internet to see who can accomplish the most outrageous random command! Film yourself completing the task and share it with your friends, then challenge them to outdo you! Or just post your videos on the internet for INSTANT FAME (or possibly infamy)!!!</p>

        <div class="bolded">Ways to Play With Friends:</div>
        <p>If you’re lucky enough to have friends, and to be in the same room (or virtual room) as them, then you can play in a couple of styles (Incorporate alcohol if/as desired!):</p>
        <p><span class="bolded">Casual:</span> Take turns rolling individually until you get a phrase you’re cool with. </p>
        <p><span class="bolded">All Play:</span> Keep rolling as a group, and when a player sees a command that they’re willing to try, they volunteer to do it! </span></p>
        <p><span class="bolded">You Can't Get Out Of It:</span> This version involves chance and strategy, for the more discerning idiot. Players take turns rolling. Each time you roll, you can choose to pass or do the task. You can roll up to five times. So once you’re on your fifth roll, you’re stuck trying your best to do whatever it says. It’s gonna get weird.</p>
        <hr noshade>
        <div class="bolded">How To WIN:</div>
        <p><span class="bolded">Play for Quantity:</span>The winner is the person who completes the most tasks, regardless of how convincingly they did it. Good for All-Play or You Can’t Get Out Of It. </p>
        <div class="bolded">OR</div>
        <p><span class="bolded">Olympic Style (Play for Quality): </span>The winner is the person with the highest cumulative score as voted on by the other players. </p>
        <p>1. Assign someone to keep score.</p>
        <p>2. After a player completes their task, the other players each give them a score based on how amazing they think it was (Score from 1-10, 10 being the best). </p>
        <p>3. The individual scores are tallied for a total score on that player’s task. The FINAL score is the cumulative score of all a player’s tasks. </p>
        <p>4. Play until you decide to stop, or someone gets arrested.</p>
        <p>5. The player with the highest final score wins the game. </p>
        <hr noshade>
        <p>When judging another player’s task completion, consider these areas:</p>
        <p><span class="bolded">Creativity & Resourcefulness</span> (Did they actually figure out a way to get inside of a smoothie?)</p>
        <p><span class="bolded">Theatricalness</span> (Did they really convince you that they were eating that bug like it was going out of style?)</p>
        <p><span class="bolded">Literal Stupidity</span> (Did they literally go to their doctor’s office and dance on the desk while yelling about anime girls? Jesus Christ.)</p>
        <p>Try All-Play or Casual in Olympic Style for a serious night of competition! Or, if you’re a real masochist, try playing You Can’t Get Out Of It in Olympic Style!</p>

        <div class="bolded">Technical Note:</div>
        <p>We don’t have a full-blown multiplayer option yet. So instead, we recommend appointing a “Game Master” to roll for everybody and keep score. Game Master, try sharing your screen in video chat!</p>
